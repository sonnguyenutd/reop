# Tetris (Sequential, Satisficing)

## Domain Description

This is a simplified version of the well-known Tetris.
All the pieces (1 × 1, 2 × 1, L) are randomly distributed on an *N* × *N* grid.
The goal is to move them in order to free the upper half of the grid.
The pieces can be rotated or translated.
Each movement action has a different cost, accordingly to the size of the piece.
